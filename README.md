# 3080-amazon-tracker
I simply need a Nvidia RTX 3080 and I'm building this to track availability on Amazon IT

The script runs in background on a Raspberry PI and (should) send me a notification when a RTX 3080 is available on Amazon as fast as possible

Update: I haven't been able to buy a 3080 yet


## How it works
